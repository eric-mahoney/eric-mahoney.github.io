            For IT 493, we partnered with local IT company <a class="underline" href="http://www.tiggee.com/" target="_blank">Tiggee</a> to build a custom survey builder and survey management web
            application that would greatly increase the number of clients that they were able to retain month to month. This software would generate unique survey links for Tiggee to send to their
            clients for feedback. Upon receiving a response from a client, this app will store this information in Tiggee's Customer Relationship Managment software (CRM).

            For this project, we knew that we had a shortened development time (4 months) along with other responsibilities (all of our members had full-time jobs and were also full-time students). As
            a result, we went with a technology stack that all of the members were familiar with and would allow us to rapidly develop this project.

          <p class="description__p line-height muted margin20t">
            The biggest problem we faced while developing this application was finding a way to store data from the Front-End to Django. Originally, the survey builder was built entirely using
            JavaScript that dynamically added in new questions and changed question types similar to Google Forms. This approach proved to be difficult when trying to save the questions to the
            database using Django Forms. As a result, we pivoted the page away from JavaScript and instead used buttons linked to Django Views that would allow us to add new questions to the database
            and then re-render them on the page. This approach allowed us to easily save each survey to the database for the marketing team to send out to clients.
